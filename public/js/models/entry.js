The days ooze lethargically from morning to night. They seem to echo each other, yet time still drags. Today was punctuated with one oddity. And a disturbing oddity it was. My parents took me out to the local cemetery to show me where my grandparents on my father's side are buried. Surely I have been there before, but the wash of bleakness the graveyard presented piqued no recognition. There was a nagging similarity, however, to the one in Pecos in which a certain Lee Tarver rots."
